# ReactPlayground
My playground to build a React app.

No practical use intended except to learn/experiment with React, JSX, flux patterns, JavaScript in general, buildchains, WebStorm IDE, and such.

## Usage
- Install: run `npm install`.
- Develop: apply elbows in your editor of choice, i use WebStorm.
- Build: run `grunt` (or `grunt watch`) to make bundle.
- Run: Open index.html in modern browser.
- Debug: mind build output, mind browser JS console, inspect React components using Chrome + React Developer Tools extension.
